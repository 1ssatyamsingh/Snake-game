# Snake-game
I built a classic Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features smooth snake movement, food generation at random positions, real-time score tracking, and game-over detection when the snake hits the wall or itself. The UI is designed with CSS for a clean layout, and the game logic is handled entirely with JavaScript using grid-based movement and keyboard controls.
